### For a tableu presentation , refer the [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/felix.musau/viz/Book1_17430834689420/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
### Data source:
This data was downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses?resource=download)
## Introduction
The choice of aircrafts significantly impacts the overrall safety, efficiency and profitability of a business. As the aviation industry is usually subject to unpredictable market conditions and mantainance challenges, understanding which aircrafts present lower risk is essential.

This analysis will assess various incidents that have occured in the past.The goal is to identify aircrafts that offer the least risk profile for the new aviation venture, while ensuring financial sustainabiity.
## Research Questions
* What has been the trend of plane crashes over the years
* What is the state with the most plane crashes
* What is the severity of injury and survival ratio of a plane crash
* what make of a plane in most prone to accidents
## Objectives
* To evaluate the trends of plane crashes over the past years
* To identify the state wih the most pane crashes
* To evaluate chances of survival after a plane crash
* To find out which model of aircrafts is most likely to get into an accident
## Data Understanding
For this research, we collected data from kaggle which contains information from 1962 and later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States, its territories and possessions, and in international waters.

Each record (row) from this dataset represents information about a certain plane accident incident.

Each column contains a different type of data related to that incident. Some of the columns are illustrated below:
* Event.Date : The date when that accident occurred
* Location : The state where that accident happened
* Airport.Name :The name of the airport where the affected plane took off from
* Injury.Severity: How severe were the injuries from the plane crash
* Make: The type of aircraft
* NUmber.Of.Engines : THe number of engines in the plane
## Findings
- Over the past years, plane crashes have reduced. THis may be attributed to the increasing safety measures that have been implemented over time.

- We have found that the top 5 most common locations for accidents is Anchorage, AK, leading with 434 incidents, then Miami,Albuquerque,NM, then Houston, then Chicago. The company should reduce investments in these states and invest in safer states

- Chances of survival after a plane crash are very low, as aviation accidents are almost 100% fatal. The losses incurred after these accidents are also very costly

- The Cessna is the most likely to get into an accident, thus the most unsafe make of airplanes. Investing into safer makes like Mileksi is advisable
## Recommendations
- It has been noted that older planes were more unsafe, and many safety features have been introduced just recently. For this reason, The company should buy newer planes for operations

- Avoid flying planes in the states listed as unsafe, and invest more on the safer states, to reduce the likely for an accident

- Aviation mistakes always turn out to big losses to a company. encourage accuracy in operations and sensitize workers on the same

- Invest on safer makes of airplanes, and avoid the unsafe ones, like the Cessnar. It should however be noted that some planes may have higher occurances of accident due to their popularity.
## Conclussion
This analysis provides us with insights about the business decission into venturing the aviation business. Accidents are said to be part of nature. It is not anyone's capability to control that. However we have calculated satistics to minimise the likelihood of such to happen. Avoiding older makes of planes is a good approach to avoiding the risks. Accuracy of employees and workers is also very crucial. Some states have been noted to be notorious for accidents. In conclussion, the aviation industry is becoming safer and profitable over time, and the business should concider investing in that industry.
